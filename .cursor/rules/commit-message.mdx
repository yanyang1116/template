# Git Commit Message Rules

## Format Requirements

All commit messages MUST follow this format:

```
type(scope): commit message in Chinese
```

### Type

The `type` field must be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Scope

The `scope` field is recommended but optional (warning level) and should indicate the module or feature area being modified:

- Should be wrapped in parentheses when used
- Should be in lowercase
- Should be concise but descriptive
- Examples: (user), (auth), (home), (api)

### Message Content

The commit message must:
- Be written in Chinese
- Start with a space after the colon
- Be clear and descriptive
- Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than "how"

## Examples

✅ Good commit messages:
```
feat(user): 添加用户登录功能
fix(home): 修复移动端显示异常
docs(readme): 更新项目说明文档
style(components): 统一按钮样式
refactor(auth): 重构认证逻辑
feat: 添加新特性（scope可选）
```

❌ Bad commit messages:
```
update code
fix bug
feat: add new feature
feat(user) no space after colon
FIX(USER): using uppercase
```

## Additional Rules

1. No period at the end of the commit message
2. Keep the total message length under 72 characters
3. Use imperative mood in the type description
4. The scope should be meaningful and accurately reflect the changed area when used
5. If multiple areas are affected, use the most significant one as the scope

## Enforcement

These rules are enforced by:
- commitlint configuration
- pre-commit hooks
- Cursor IDE integration

Following these rules helps maintain a clean and meaningful git history, making it easier to:
- Track project progress
- Review changes
- Generate changelogs
- Understand project evolution
